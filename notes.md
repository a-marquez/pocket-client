NOTES
---
- pocket api does not support cors
- client-side is not viable, lack of cors means the queries can only return as opaque responses that are not consumable by client javascript
- portfolio friendly distributions could be an npm service, packaged electron app, and a github pages demo with a localStorage backed mock api
- it seems pocket api sort is ignored when querying large data amounts
